# Uncommon Expo CLI Error: Cryptic Build Failures

This repository demonstrates an example of an uncommon error encountered when using the Expo CLI. The error lacks specific details, making debugging challenging.  The focus here is on identifying potential causes and providing solutions. 

## Problem

The Expo CLI build process or `expo start` command fails without a clear indication of the root cause. The error messages are often generic, offering little help in pinpointing the issue. This commonly occurs when using newer libraries or configurations not fully supported by the current Expo setup.

## Solution

The solution involves systematically checking several aspects of the project:

1. **Expo CLI Version:** Ensure you're using a compatible version of the Expo CLI with your project's dependencies and features.
2. **Project Configuration:** Verify that `app.json` and `package.json` are correctly configured and don't contain conflicting entries. 
3. **Library Compatibility:** Check if all libraries used are compatible with your Expo SDK version. Consider using older, more stable versions if there are compatibility issues.
4. **Native Modules:** If using native modules, ensure they're properly linked and configured.
5. **Clean and Rebuild:** Sometimes, a clean build resolves transient errors.
