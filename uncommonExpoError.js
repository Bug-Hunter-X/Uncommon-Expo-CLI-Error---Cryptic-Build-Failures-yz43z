This error typically occurs when you're using a feature or library within Expo that isn't fully compatible with the version of Expo CLI you're using.  It might also appear if there are inconsistencies in your project's configuration files (like `app.json` or `package.json`).  The error message itself often lacks specificity, making it hard to pinpoint the exact cause. For example, you might encounter a cryptic error during the build process, or problems linking native modules. 

Here's an example scenario. You might be using a relatively new React Native library which hasn't yet been fully optimized for the Expo managed workflow.  Trying to integrate this library could lead to build failures that manifest as this generic Expo CLI error.
